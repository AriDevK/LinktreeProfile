  description: `
      Hello it's me Ari, I'm 22 years old and I'm studying my last year of computer systems engineering.
      I'm focused on backend and desktop development and I'm really interested on design patterns, clean architectures, testing and learn new technologies.
      Mainly I work using C#, Python and some .NET Tools & Frameworks but sometimes I code on some different things like Golang, Powershell, PHP or even in some embedded devices like Arduino, RasperryPI or ESP32.
