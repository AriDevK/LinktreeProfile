## ðŸ—³ Justification
At this moment I'm using the LinkTree app in order to have all my social links on a single page, but also at this moment I'm paying for a domain 
that is not serving to much so in order to practice my new angular skills and also put this domain to work a developed this application ðŸ¥°

On this project I practice things like:
- Angular CLI
- Angular Material
- Components
- Pipes
- Saas
- TypeScript

<br>


## ðŸ’­ Things to do

These are things that I will implement later
- Connect to my API in order to fetch the links
- Made available on spanish language
- Check mobile responsive.
